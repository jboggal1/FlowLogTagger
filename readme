Assumptions:
Log Format: The program only supports the default log format (VPC Flow Logs format), not custom formats. Specifically, it supports version 2, where fields are structured in a fixed format.

Protocol Mapping: Only standard protocols are supported, including TCP (protocol number 6), UDP (protocol number 17), and ICMP (all others default to icmp).

Dependencies: The program does not use any non-default libraries or packages (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Pandas) and can be run on a local machine with just a JDK installed.

Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK): Java 8 or higher

Compile the Program:
Navigate to the programâ€™s directory in the terminal and compile the program with:
javac FlowLogTagger.java

Run the Program:
Execute the program with:
java FlowLogTagger

Testing with Sample Data:
A sample lookup.csv with various (dstport, protocol, tag) combinations was created, as well as a flow_logs.txt file with flow log entries in the default format. The program successfully categorized and counted entries based on this sample data.
